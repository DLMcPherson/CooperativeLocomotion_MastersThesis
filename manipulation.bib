title="Self-assemblages in insect societies",
journal="Insectes Sociaux",
year="2002",
month="May",
day="01",
volume="49",
number="2",
pages="99--110",
abstract="In insect societies, a number of very striking collective structures are formed by individuals linking themselves to one another. One such example is an army ant bivouac. These structures are termed self-assemblages and are part of a more general and important aspect of insect societies - intermediate-level parts - in which functional group-level adaptive structures are formed. These parts are, in a sense, the tissues and organs of complex insect societies. Here we review the natural history of self-assemblages in insect societies. We find that at least 18 different types of structure exist: bivouacs, bridges, curtains, droplets, escape droplets, festoons, fills, flanges, ladders, ovens, plugs, pulling chains, queen clusters, rafts, swarms, thermoregulatory clusters, tunnels, and walls. These self-assemblages are found in a variety of species of ants, bees, and wasps, but (as far as we are aware) not in termites. The function of these self-assemblages can be grouped under five broad categories which are not mutually exclusive: 1) defence, 2) pulling structures, 3) thermoregulation, 4) colony survival under inclement conditions, and 5) ease of passage when crossing an obstacle. The paucity of our knowledge concerning the factors that favour self-assemblage formation and the likely proximate mechanisms are highlighted.",

journal="Insectes Sociaux",

month="Dec",
day="01",
volume="48",
number="4",
pages="291--301",
abstract="Insect societies function at various organisational levels. Most research has focused on one or other organisational extreme. At one extreme, it is the adaptive behaviours at the individual level, the behaviour of workers, which is of interest. At the other extreme, colony-level adaptive behaviour and swarm intelligence is the focus. However, between these two extremes, numerous functional adaptive units, or ``parts,'' exist. These intermediate-level parts include the behavioural properties of ``groups'' or ``teams'' in which the functionality only emerges at the group-level and not within the individuals themselves, and also the structural properties of ``self-assemblages'' in which individuals link themselves together to form an adaptive configuration, such as a living bridge. We review another type of intermediate-level part in insect societies: these are the physical structures that ants build away from the nest. The structures, that are larger than an individual worker but smaller than the colony (hence intermediate), include cleared trails, walled trenches, arcades, tunnels, outstations, shelters, protective pens, shelters over nectaries, food coverings on foraging trails, elevated corridors, and bridges. They are found in a diverse range of species, and are constructed using a variety of materials. We detail the structures built by ants focussing chiefly on the adaptive benefits these structures may confer to the colony.",
